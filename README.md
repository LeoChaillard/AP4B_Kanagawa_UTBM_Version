# AP4B - Kanagawa UTBM version
Java project carried during the AP4B course. We've revisited the Kanagawa game based on our school's (UTBM) majors and courses structure.


## How to play ?

  - During your turn, you can either pass or pick up an available column of cards. 
  - By passing, you'll be able to see a new row of cards for each remaining column. You can't pass if there is only one reamining column on the board, or if the 3 rows are already filled up.
  - By picking up a column, you'll be able to take the column of cards you wish.
  - Once cards have been added to your temporary hand, you can click them to see your choices.
  - If you decide to work on your project, you have to make sure that you've placed your hours one the required skills in your inventory.
  - If you decide to keep a card in your hand, you have to make sure that you possess at least one KEEP_IN_HAND bonus in you inventory.
  - If you possess an imsi token bonus, you'll be able to change the branch (INFO, GMC, EDIM, ENERGIE) by clicking on of one your project cards from your inventory 'cards' tab.
  - You may be able to get mentions offers by earning enough skills, bonus or cards elements.
  - You won't be able to get higher mentions in a given field as soon as you accept a mention form this field.
  - The game will stop as soon as one player reaches 11 cards in his project, or the deck of cards is empty.
  - Points will be counted based on the collected scoring points, the number of cards in your project and the biggest combo of same-branch following cards (imsi-branch cards will be automatically transformed for that).
